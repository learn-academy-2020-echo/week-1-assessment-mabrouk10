# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is something that takes an argument(s) and will perform/change/manipulate the argument(s) in some way 

  Researched answer: It is like a machine that has an input and an output. And the output is related somehow to the input. A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing



2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: .map() will take an array and return a new array according to what it is you are looking for. .filter() will remove elements in a given array and return a new array with the removed elements gone.

  Researched answer: Map takes all objects in a list and allows you to apply a function to it whereas Filter takes all objects in a list and runs that through a function to create a new list with all objects that return True in that function. Hence, knowing the functionality and using it accordingly is important as both the functions have very minute difference in there functionality.


3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() is used to print something out in your terminal and is also used to test your working code. return is used in functions so a given function can return a value.

  Researched answer: The main purpose of the return value, is to use the function return value like you would have use a variable value. the console.log(); is a function (you can see the brackets) that will write the argument value on the console. And only the debuging console, in a browser you will not see anything on the screen.


4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: arguments are what is being passed down into a function. the function will run and adjust/manipulate/change the argument. the arguments can also serve as ingredients in a recipe.

  Researched answer: Arguments in the function call are matched to parameters in the function definition based on their position within the lists; that is, each argument must correspond to exactly one parameter based on position. The position of both arguments and parameters is determined by the commas that separate each element in either list.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: pair programming is done with two or more people. One will be a driver and one will be a navigator. The driver will code and the navigator will guide the driver. Just like when people drive in cars. One will drive and one will guide the driver using a gps.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently


6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: TDD is test driven development. Using Jest is an example of tdd. Where you want to test the code you have worked on. 

  Researched answer: Test-driven development (TDD) is a development technique where you must first write a test that fails before you write new functional code. TDD is being quickly adopted by agile software developers for development of application source code and is even being adopted by Agile DBAs for database development.


7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Office hours were really helpful. Instructors giving plenty of opportunties to ask questions. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- Classes
A class is written by a programmer in a defined structure to create an object (computer science) in an object oriented programming language. ... For example, a class could be a car, which could have a color field, four tire fields, and a drive method.

- React
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”

- React State
React components has a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

- CRUD

In computer programming, create, read, update, and delete are the four basic functions of persistent storage. Alternate words are sometimes used when defining the four basic functions of CRUD, such as retrieve instead of read, modify instead of update, or destroy instead of delete.
